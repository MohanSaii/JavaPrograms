    /*Collection Framework = group of objects (to avoid the drawback of arrays)
    alll data strucutres classes are the part of collection framework
    Draw back of array: array has fixed sizes
    collection--Dynamic collection of objects (works on entire collection)

    java.util ( all collection related packages are in here, so import this to use collection packages)
    --Collection--(--IMP-part--)(related to core java)
    1. List-can store duplicate values, ordered collection
    (It is has index so it is known as ordered collection)(list of MobileNumbers,Students etc)
    built-in-classes---Vector(thread-safe), ArrayList(not thread-safe), LinkedList(scattered-format), Stack((LIFO)last-in first-out)

    2. Set-can store unique values, unordered collection 
    (storing only unique values) (set doesn't have index so unordered collection)(the output comes in unordered way)
    classes---HashSet(sub-interfaces) (for ascending or descending)
    SortedSet-in ascending order
    NevigableSet--for seraching
    classes---Treeset(for automatic sorting)

    3. Queue-setting priority 
    (this is also a list-type but priority based)
    Deque-double ended queue (sub-interfaces)
    classes---PriorityQueue


    Map-key value pair (to-store two values like EmployeeName-EmployeeID)
    classes--- HashMap 
    SortedMap-sorted map
    NevigableMap-searching
    classes--- TreeMap

    Comparator and comparable---used for comparison of objects

    Iterator-traversing
